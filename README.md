Photogrammetry uses non-contact images or scans of objects to derive three-dimensional (3D) models from surface measurements. It can be used as an analytical tool to measure the surface characteristics of objects or environments, as well as a method to display and inspect them digitally. Photogrammetry can be used to create accurate 3D models without physically removing or inspecting the object.
#Project Overview

The project focuses on creating 3D models from 2D images using photogrammetry techniques. The main components of the project include:


**cv2:**
used for image processing and computer vision The library allows working with images and videos is a Python library of OpenCV 

**CloudeCompare:**

Mainly used in photogrammetry for analysis and processing of point clouds created from conversions of 2D images to 3D models
Its main use is:
**.**Processing and cleaning point clouds: noise cleaning, removing irrelevant points and focusing on the required area
Comparing models:
*.* Making comparisons between point clouds or between models for example, comparing a point cloud created from new measurements with a previous cloud to detect changes
