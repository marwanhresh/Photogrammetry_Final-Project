Photogrammetry uses non-contact images or scans of objects to derive three-dimensional (3D) models from surface measurements. It can be used as an analytical tool to measure the surface characteristics of objects or environments, as well as a method to display and inspect them digitally. Photogrammetry can be used to create accurate 3D models without physically removing or inspecting the object.
